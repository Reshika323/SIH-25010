## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

# Proposed Solution
Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution

The solution is a Smart Crop Advisory System — an AI-powered, multilingual mobile and web platform that offers personalized agricultural recommendations. Farmers will input or upload information such as crop type, soil data, and pest images. The system will analyze data using AI and IoT-based models to provide instant advisory on optimal crops, fertilizers, and pest management practices. Integration with satellite weather APIs will deliver timely alerts for rainfall, temperature, and disease risks.

## How It Addresses the Problem

• Provides scientific, data-driven advice replacing guesswork.

• Delivers recommendations in local languages with voice assistance for inclusivity.

• Offers real-time pest and disease identification using image recognition.

• Reduces input costs and improves yield by promoting sustainable and targeted farming practices.

• Connects farmers with market price updates to improve profit margins.

## Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

• Combines AI, IoT, and satellite data for comprehensive advisory.

• Integrates image recognition for pest/disease identification.

• Multilingual voice chatbot bridges digital literacy gaps.

• Offers data analytics dashboard for government and NGOs to monitor agricultural patterns.

• Scalable to different states and adaptable to diverse crops and climates.

# Technical Approach
## Technologies to Be Used

• Frontend: React Native (for mobile), React.js (for web)

• Backend: Django REST Framework / Node.js

• Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase

• AI/ML Models: TensorFlow or PyTorch for pest image recognition and yield prediction

• APIs: OpenWeatherMap API, Government soil data APIs

• Cloud Services: AWS / Google Cloud for hosting and analytics

## Methodology and Process for Implementation

• Data Collection: Soil, crop, and weather data from government and open sources.

• Model Development: Train AI models for pest identification and crop recommendation.

• App Development: Build a multilingual mobile and web interface with chatbot integration.

• Testing: Pilot testing with local farmer groups for feedback.

• Deployment: Deploy on cloud with real-time advisory updates.

• Monitoring: Collect feedback and usage analytics for improvement.

# Feasibility and Viability
## Analysis of Feasibility
The project is feasible using existing open datasets, affordable cloud infrastructure, and widely available AI/ML tools. Partnerships with agricultural universities and local NGOs can support data validation and farmer outreach.

## Potential Challenges and Risks
• Limited internet connectivity in rural areas

• Low digital literacy among users

• Regional language variations

• Difficulty in real-time data integration

## Strategies for Overcoming These Challenges
• Enable offline mode and SMS/IVR support for low-connectivity regions.

• Use voice commands and local languages for user interaction.

• Collaborate with local agricultural officers for farmer onboarding.

• Use edge computing for real-time predictions in remote areas.

# Impact and Benefits
Potential Impact on the Target Audience
Empowers small and marginal farmers with actionable, scientific advice, improving productivity and sustainability.

## Benefits of the Solution

Social: Enhances rural empowerment and digital inclusion.

Economic: Reduces input costs and increases crop yield and income.

Environmental: Promotes responsible fertilizer and pesticide usage, reducing pollution and soil degradation.
